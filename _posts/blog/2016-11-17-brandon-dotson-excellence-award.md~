This is what the nomination said:

"I was initially going to nominate him as an Outstanding President for his great dedication and vision leading IEEE. He has been able to put together several events: tours, talks, competitions (IEEExtreme on Friday!). He is also truly passionate about this and he is currently leading a project within the organization focused on Arduino.

However, I then realized that he has not only been a President of IEEE, but that his commitment to this team comes from way back. For what I know, he also served as an excellent Projects Chair, managing projects as the previously mentioned Arduino project and the Kinect project.

Through all these years, he has been a great advocate of promotion through our website, Facebook, TechNews and many other means to move IEEE to the student body. Under his leadership, IEEE has enjoyed brilliant years and is ready to face the future thanks to his legacy."
