Before we go into the details, you might ask, "what... is... this???"

IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members—advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch—compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems.
 
Obviously, this is a very (like VERY) good opportunity to showcase your programming skills and to network with other people who loves programming as you do!

*"Alright, so tell me why this worth my time man".* It's cause, when you win the...

**1st place:** The winning team members will receive an expenses-paid trip to an IEEE conference of their choice, anywhere around the world. Roundtrip coach airline tickets for each winner from winner’s preferred major metropolitan airport to the conference destination, conference registration fees, and a three night hotel stay (confirmation pending) will be provided by IEEE for winning team members.

**2nd place:** Each member of the team that wins 2nd place in the IEEEXtreme 9.0 competition will receive an iPad Air.

**3rd place:** Each member of the team that wins 3rd place in the IEEEXtreme 9.0 competition will receive an iPad Mini.

**4th-10th place:** Each member of the 4th through 10th place teams in the IEEEXtreme 9.0 competition will receive a Raspberry Pi computer.
 
**Top 100:** All members of teams that place in the top 100 at the end of the competition will receive a special edition IEEEXtreme 9.0 gift bundle, including a reserved IEEEXtreme “Top Coder” t-shirt and a valuable [Essential Studio Enterprise Edition](http://www.syncfusion.com/sales/products) license for a comprehensive development suite that includes 650+ components across multiple platforms. This gift is courtesy of our sponsorship partner Syncfusion.

If you think, *"Fantastic! How can I register??"*, well first see if you fulfill these requirement points:

  * All participants must be IEEE members ([Student member](http://www.ieee.org/go/join_student) or Graduate Student member only) to register and compete in the competition. IEEE membership numbers are required.
  * Participants must compete as part of a team of up to three IEEE Student or Graduate Student members. Teams should only include a maximum of two Graduate Student members per team. 
  * Each team must have a proctor to supervise during the 24-hour programming competition. 
  * Team members must solve and complete the problems without assistance from others

One good news is, that you will have a proctor already, which is Bob Burke, the head of IEEE Chicago Section.
