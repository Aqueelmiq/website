Our peer Computer Engineering student, Mete Morris, delivered a great presentation of his internship experience last summer for a group of students. The event was open for anyone interested, whether a member of IEEE or not.

It was a great occasion in which we all learnt a lot about the job application process and about how it might be to work for a medium-sized Chicagoan engineering firm. <!--more-->Mete talked about the issues international students could find along the way, as well as about the adaptation process he had to go through as an intern. He also transmitted to us his immense gratitude at having experienced such a satisfying and beneficial opportunity!

IEEE thanks Mete for his great presentation, which he has now been asked to deliver at another university in Chicago. We were all delighted to hear about his experience, and it taught us a lot! Therefore, IEEE is glad to announce a Student-Speaker Series: any student who is interested in sharing a relevant experience or in presenting for IEEE and other members, can email <a href="mailto:ieee@iit.edu?Subject=Student-Speaker%20Series%20Proposal">ieee@iit.edu</a>. The executive board will then review the application and prepare the event if approved. Don't be shy and show us what you've got!
