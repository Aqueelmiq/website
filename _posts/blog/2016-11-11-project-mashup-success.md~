The first ever Project Mashup event held by the executive board of 2016-2017 was a huge success. There were over 20 registered teams, and over 50 participants participating in the event.<!--more--> The spirit of the event resulted in a lot of participants showing up to the event who were not able to register in time. The event started sharp at 4:00pm. The event was divided in two parts. For the first two hours, the teams would come up with a product idea based on the constraints given to them. After that, the teams moved to an auditorium to deliver pitches regarding their product. The teams participating showed great spirit and enthusiasm throughout the whole event. Jimmy Johnâ€™s sandwiches were available for the participants to help them with brainstorming. 

Some great ideas were presented during the event. For example, a team wanted to build an autonomous drone to help people stuck in fire. Some teams wanted to build drones for farming purposes. All participants had the chance of pursuing their project further with IEEE funding if they wanted to. A short survey was given out to the participants at the end of the event, and by the survey results it was clear that everyone had enjoyed the event.
